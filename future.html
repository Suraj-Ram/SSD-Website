        <h1>Future</h1>
        
        <p>The new trend in SSDs is the use the M.2 connector on the motherboard. The first type of M.2 SSDs are to use SATA, the same interface that full-size hard drives and 2.5” SSDs use. You get the exact same speeds as a regular 2.5” SATA SSD, but you save space. Something that might be useful if want to have a small PC like an Intel NUC, plus laptops can get thinner and thinner as they don’t need to include the space to accommodate a relatively large 2.5” SSD.</p>
        <p>For example, the Samsung 850 Evo SSD (full size, 2.5 inch), a very popular choice for consumers, has a sequential read speed of 540 Mbps and write speed of 520 Mbps. The M.2 for factor of the same SSD has the same speed of 540 Mbps, read and 520 Mbps, write. However, the M.2 SATA variant is smaller and consumes less power. But, funny enough both of them sell for the same price of $200 MSRP.</p>
        <p>The more recent type of M.2 SSDs are SSDs that use the NVMe (Non-volatile Memory Express) interface. These SSDs run much, much faster as they use one of the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) lanes that connect directly to the CPU. One of the more recent ones are the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-960-pro-m-2-2tb-mz-v6p2t0bw/" target="_blank" class="sources-link">Samsung 960 Pro</a> it can store upto 2TB while being 8cm in length, 2cm in width and just 0.2cm thick. The speeds are crazy fast as it can do a 3,5000 MB/s read and 2,100MB write (Both are sequential speeds). The small M.2 connector lets it fit into really small laptops and other devices like Intel NUCs.

            <p class="img-caption" style="left: 500px;">This is the Samsung 960 Pro one of the best SSDs. The dimensions are 800mm x 221mm x 2.3mm and it stores upto 2TB. The MSRP now (as of January 2018) is $1,300. </p>
